I've been drafting fantasy football teams for 30 years and there have been a lot of lessons learned.  One of my biggest lessons is don't draft your team based on last year's season.  While I try depending on my draft order to draft the best player available for position I need to fill, it's anyone's guess how the season with go.  There will be breakout players that no one saw coming, injuries that send us all scrambling on waivers for their backups and players that underperform.  In the end, it's your team and no one truly knows who the studs and duds will be this season.  That's why the draft is just stage one in a season where you'll have to make adjustments as the season unfolds if you want to win your league.
