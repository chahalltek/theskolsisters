Always familiarize yourself with the rules of your league before drafting.  Leagues have different scoring.  Some are standard or some are PPR.   PPR stands for point per reception.  Some leagues give a full point per reception and other just a half point reception.  In those leagues, I usually draft a wide receiver in the first round.
