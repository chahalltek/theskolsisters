If you are new to drafting in fantasy football, make sure to do a mock draft or two prior to your draft.  Most drafts are online where you are able to log into your draft at the scheduled time or the computer will auto draft your team.  Always try to avoid auto drafting.  While the computer will begin draft back up kickers, tight ends, defenses etc., those of us drafting our teams are stacking our bench with extra running backs and wide receivers.
