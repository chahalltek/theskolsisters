We break the season into five stages:

1. **Drafting** — Understand tiers and positional cliffs.
2. **Managing Your Team** — Waivers, trades, and tilt control.
3. **Stack Your Bench** — Prioritize contingent value over low-ceiling depth.
4. **Preparing for the Playoffs** — Schedule scouting & upside moves.
5. **Playoffs** — Weekly matchups and high-variance flex plays.
