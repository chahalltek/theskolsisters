Most of us do not find out our draft order for most online drafts until 15 minutes or so before the draft.  Offline drafts or in person drafts sometimes you may have more time to think about your draft position and strategy.  Be flexible.  Especially in my all ladies leagues there are always surprises and you need to adjust.  Personally if I am not in the top 3 of the draft order, I prefer to be last pic and take 2 solid top tier players back to back.  We don't win the league on draft day, but picking the best players available during the draft gives you the best odds of making the playoffs.
